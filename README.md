# Study-Clock
You want to study more effectively? Here's a GUI that helps keep track of your study time and increases focus.

Click the start button to begin your study session. A complete study cycle is 4 sessions. And a checkmark appears at the end of every session.
This study tool let's you study for 25min(one session) with a short break of 5min at the end of that session. After a complete study cycle has been achieved, you're rewarded with a 20min recess to help recupperate.And then you can begin your cycle again. 
Use the reset button to RESET. 

If you can study for a longer period, you can increase your study session time by editing the code base file -> WORK_MIN constant to whatever time of your choice in minutes.
